# preceptron
examples of implementing **perceptron algorithm**

* This example shows the simple application of preceptron in student data separation, for admission and or, and, xor, not gate imlementation.

* Here we can see exactly how the preceptron trains to find equation for a line for separating the data.

> _Although we have lots of libraries in python :) for using it rather to go for code of this big !(, but its a basic to understand how we can think of algorithm works to give result rather than seeing output directly +-/.
:)_


## here we see how the simple preceptron will be implemented
```
(Node1)\
        \Weight1
         \
          +----->(sum_function)--->(Activation function _|''')----->output
         /
        /Weight2
(Node2)/
```
