## This example shows the simple application of preceptron in student data separation, for taking an admission.
* Here we can see exactly how the preceptron trains to find equation for a line for separating the data.
> _Although we have lots of libraries in python :) for using it rather to go for code of this big !(, but its a basic to understand how we can think of algorithm works to give result rather than seeing output directly +-/.

## the graph looks like
```
X1_
   \
    \	(step func)   __ YES__
     \     __      /	      \
X2----( __|   )---<            +--> y^
     /.            \__ NO____/
    /
   /
  /
 b
```
