> _This example shows the simple application of preceptron in student data separation, for admission.
Here we can see exactly how the preceptron trains to find equation for a line for separating the data.
Although we have lots of libraries in python :) for using it rather to go for code of this big !(, but its a basic to understand how we can think of algorithm works to give result rather than seeing output directly +-/.
